Project for Udacity course React nanodegree. Started with the static template. Added React components and the dynamic functionality on the client side (except the BooksAPI.js file). The server side is up to Udacity.

## Run the app

Firstly install all project dependencies with `npm install`. Then start the development server with `npm start`.
